Prophecy provides a complete workflow for data analysts: generate pipelines with AI, refine them visually, and deploy production-ready code. The platform integrates with multiple cloud data platforms, so you can read in data, write out data, and execute transformations without switching between tools.

This approach removes the gap between AI-generated logic and deployable code. You iterate visually while Prophecy maintains the underlying codebase, which serves as a single source of truth. Within this system, you can seamlessly integrate your software best practices, version control, and governance policies.

Getting started is easy. Just sign up, create a project, and start building your first pipeline.
