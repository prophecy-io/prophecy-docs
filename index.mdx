Prophecy provides a complete workflow for data analysts: generate pipelines with AI, refine them visually, and deploy production-ready code. The platform integrates with multiple data platforms, enabling you to build and execute transformations without switching between tools.

This approach removes the gap between AI-generated logic and deployable code. You iterate visually while Prophecy maintains the underlying codebase, ensuring that what you build in the interface matches what executes in production.

You have everything required to create pipelines from one browser tab—no installation required. Just sign up, create a project, and start building your first pipeline.
