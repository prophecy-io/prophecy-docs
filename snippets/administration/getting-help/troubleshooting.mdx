Prophecy projects can run into occasional issues related to version control, deployments, connections, or runtime environments. This page collects common problems and their solutions.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Changes to project are not persisted">

If you are working on a project and don't see changes that you previously made, several issues could be the cause:

- You are on a different branch than the one containing your changes.
- Another user may have overwritten your changes or reverted commits.
- Multiple tabs were open, and one version overwrote another. This happens in the Normal Git Storage Model. The Simple Git Storage Model's single-user mode prevents this. Learn more in [Real-time collaboration](/data-analytics/development/versioning/collaboration-modes).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="My pipeline is read-only">

If you cannot make edits in the pipeline canvas:

- The pipeline may have been imported from another project, which makes it non-editable. Pipelines are only editable from the original project.
- The pipeline might be [locked](/data-analytics/development/versioning/collaboration-modes) to prevent merge conflicts when others are editing the same project. If this is the case, you'll be able to see who is editing the pipeline at that time and can request control of the pipeline.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Pipeline run fails">

A pipeline run may fail with generic or unknown errors.

- Check runtime logs for detailed error messages.
- Confirm that all inputs, expressions, and connections are correctly configured.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I can't view someone else's project">

A project may not appear in your workspace if you are not part of the assigned team.

- Verify your team membership for the project.
- Ask an admin to update team access if necessary.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="No data was written to the target">

Even if a pipeline runs successfully, the target table may remain empty.

- Confirm that the target connection is valid and not expired.
- Check that the write mode settings are correctly configured.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The wrong data was written to the target">

Output may not match expectations due to incorrect pipeline logic or write mode settings.

- Verify write mode settings (Append vs. Overwrite).
- Check filters and expressions in the pipeline logic.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="My schedule didn't run">

Scheduled pipelines may fail to trigger if the project containing the schedule is unpublished.

- Ensure the project is published and the schedule is active.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="My SQLStatement gem won't run">

Custom SQL may fail if syntax is incorrect or the dialect is unsupported.

- Verify SQL syntax and ensure the dialect used matches your SQL warehouse dialect.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="My connection stopped working">

Pipeline errors — especially with Source and Target gems — may occur if credentials or tokens have expired.

- Update connection credentials and any saved secrets.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Scheduled pipeline runs start failing">

Previously successful pipelines may fail if connections expire, schemas change, or other edits occur.

- Update expired connection credentials.
- Check Source/Target gems for schema changes.
- Review pipeline version history to identify changes made by others.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I don't see some datasets from my connections">

Prophecy cannot retrieve datasets if the authenticated identity does not have access on the connection side.

- Confirm that your credentials grant access to the required datasets in the origin data source.
