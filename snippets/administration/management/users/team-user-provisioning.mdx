1. Click **Continue**.
1. **([Enterprise Edition](/data-engineering/administration/platform/editions) only)** Enable or disable Spark execution metrics for the team.
1. Click **Complete** to save the new team.

## Create users

After you define the teams, invite new users to those teams.

1. Go to **Metadata → Users**.
1. Click **+ Invite Users**.
1. In the **Invite User** dialog:
   - Enter one or more email addresses.
   - Select the team the user will join.

The system creates the accounts and emails the invitation links to users.
