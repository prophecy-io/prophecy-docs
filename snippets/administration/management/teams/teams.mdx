Teams represent groups of users who collaborate on projects and share access to resources. When you create a project or a fabric, you assign it to a team. All users in that team will have access to the relevant project or fabric.

## Team types

There are two types of teams in Prophecy.

- **Shared teams:** Your [team admin](/data-analytics/administration/management/users/access/role-based-access) typically creates additional team groupings. Team structures will vary across organizations. To learn about best practices for organizing teams, visit [Team-based access](/data-analytics/administration/management/users/access/team-based-access).
- **Personal teams:** When you start using Prophecy, you are automatically assigned to your own one-person team. You are also the team admin of this team. If you want a project or fabric to be accessible only to yourself, you can assign it to your personal team and keep it private.

## Team admins

Team admins are responsible for managing the structure and resources of a team. They can:

- [Create and manage](/data-analytics/administration/management/users/team-user-provisioning) teams and team members.
- Create and configure fabrics for the team.
- Set up connections and secrets.
- Manage additional team-level settings.

There can be multiple team admins per team, and any existing team admin can promote another user to this role.
