Default projects are project dependencies that are automatically imported into new projects created within the team. This makes sense if your team frequently creates projects that use the same packages.

<Info>Only team admins can access and modify default project dependencies for their team.</Info>

## Accessing default projects

To configure default projects for a team:

1. Open the **Metadata** icon in the left navigation bar.
1. Select the **Teams** tab in the page header.
1. Click on the team to open its metadata page.
1. Click the **Settings** tab.
1. Navigate to the **Advanced** subtab.

The Default Projects section displays all projects currently configured as defaults for the team.

## Default projects table

The Default Projects table shows all projects that will be automatically imported into new projects. Each entry displays:

- **Project**: The project name from Package Hub.
- **Description**: Optional description of the project's purpose.
- **Version**: The specific version of the project that will be imported.

New projects will automatically import the latest version of the default projects.

## Managing default projects

### Adding default projects

To add projects to the default list:

1. Open the **Add projects** dropdown.
1. Select projects from the Package Hub that you want to include as defaults.
1. The selected projects appear in the table.

You can select any project from the Package Hub to include as a default dependency. If you add default dependencies written in different languages, Prophecy will only automatically import the dependencies written in the same language as the project.

### Removing default projects

To remove a default project:

1. Locate the project in the Default Projects table.
1. Hover the project you want to remove.
1. Click the **trash** icon.
