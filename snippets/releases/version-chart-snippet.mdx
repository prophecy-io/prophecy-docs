## Version chart

The version chart shows an up-to-date list of all Prophecy versions and the corresponding Prophecy library versions that are released with the Prophecy version.

Prophecy versions that are labeled with `EM` are Extended Maintenance releases. For more information, see [Version support lifecycle](/releases/version-support).

<Note>

- In most cases, libraries are backwards compatible. You won't always have to update your library
  dependencies when you upgrade to a new Prophecy version.
- If you update your Prophecy Scala
  library dependencies, you might need to update the Spark and Scala versions of your cluster to
  match the new library versions.

</Note>

<Tip>

You can query this table using the following API and your Prophecy personal access token:

```bash
curl  --header 'X-Auth-Token: $PROPHECY_PAT' --location https://app.prophecy.io/api/editor/plibVersions
```
