title: Use the RestAPI gem
description: Make API calls directly from pipelines
---

The [RestAPI gem](/data-analytics/gems/custom/rest-api) allows you to make API calls from your pipeline—including Prophecy APIs. Review this example to learn how to use the RestAPI gem to trigger a pipeline run.

## Example configuration

Populate the gem configuration with the following values:

- Target Column Name: `api_response`
- URL: `https://app.prophecy.io/api/trigger/pipeline`
- Method: `POST`
- Parse API response as JSON: `false` (Disabled)
- Authentication: None
- Params: None
- Body: `{ "fabricId": <fabricID>, "pipelineName": "customer_orders", "parameters": {}, "projectId": "<projectID>" }`
- Headers:
  - Content-Type: `application/json`
  - X-AUTH-TOKEN: `<prophecy-access-token-secret>`

<Tip>
  We recommend that you store your Prophecy access token as a secret, rather than hardcoding it in
  the gem configuration. You can reference the secret by clicking **+ > Secret** in the value field.
</Tip>

## Monitoring

When you run the pipeline that includes the RestAPI gem, you will see the following in the Run History interface:

- A record of the pipeline run that triggers the child pipeline using the RestAPI gem.
- A record of the triggered pipeline run that has the type `API Run`.
