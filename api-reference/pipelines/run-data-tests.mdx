Use this endpoint to run data tests built on [dbt generic data tests](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/data-tests#generic-data-tests).

## Requirements

To run the API, you need to:

- Set up your generic test definitions in the Prophecy UI. Learn more about [generic test definitions](/data-analytics/development/tests/use-model-tests).
- Ensure that the tables you want to test have data. If you create a pipeline that writes to a new table, you must run the pipeline first to populate the table with data. This gives data tests something to check against; otherwise, tests may fail or result in errors due to lack of data.

<Note>Limitation: This endpoint currently requires an active UI session.</Note>
