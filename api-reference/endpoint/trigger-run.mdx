title: 'Trigger pipeline run'
---

Trigger the execution of a pipeline in a deployed project. This is useful when you want to automate pipeline runs without relying on Prophecy's built-in scheduling.

## Requirements

To run the API, the target pipeline must:

- Run on a Prophecy fabric.
- Be part of a published project.

  In other words, the pipeline must be deployed.



## Endpoint

```
https://app.prophecy.io/api/trigger/pipeline
```

  Replace the base URL with your environment URL for Dedicated SaaS deployments.
