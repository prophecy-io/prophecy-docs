Properties for text secrets are specified in the `properties` object when creating or updating a secret. Text secrets store plain text values such as API keys, service account JSON, or other string-based credentials.

## Properties

<ParamField body="name" type="string" required>
  The key name for the secret. This name is used to reference the secret in connections and other
  resources.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="value" type="string" required>
  The secret value as a plain text string. For service account keys, this should be the complete
  JSON string.
</ParamField>
