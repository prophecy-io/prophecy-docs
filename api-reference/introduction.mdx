description: 'Use APIs to interact with your Prophecy deployment'
---

The Prophecy API provides programmatic access to your Prophecy deployment through REST endpoints. These endpoints accept JSON payloads and return structured responses, enabling integration with CI/CD pipelines, monitoring systems, and custom automation scripts. All requests require authentication via a Personal Access Token in the request headers.

<Info>
  Prophecy has an additional set of APIs that you can request through Prophecy Support. Reach out to
  Support to learn more.

## Endpoints

Each endpoint uses your Prophecy environment URL as the base URL. Replace the base URL with your environment URL for Dedicated SaaS deployments.

## Access tokens

Prophecy uses your Personal Access Token (PAT) for authentication with our API servers. To manage your access tokens:

1. Open your Prophecy environment.
2. At the bottom of the left sidebar, click the **...** menu.
3. Click the gear icon to open Settings.
4. Navigate to the **Access Tokens** tab.

Here, you will see any PATs you have previously created. You can also find information such as creation date, expiration status, and time of last use.

<Note>
  Access tokens are per user. Therefore, API permissions are scoped to your user permissions.
</Note>

### Generate an access token

To generate a new access token:

1. Open the **Access Tokens** tab in Settings.
2. Click **Generate Token**.
3. Name your token.
4. Choose an expiration date from the dropdown menu.
5. Click **Create**.
6. Copy your newly-generated token before closing the dialog. You will not be able to access the token value again.
