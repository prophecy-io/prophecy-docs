<Note>
  You can only add one secret and one connection in the same request. In most cases, the connection
  will require a secret, so these will be created together.
</Note>

<Tip>
The `connection.properties` object and `secret.properties` object depend on the connection type and secret type. Find specific properties in the following API documentation sections:

- **Connections > Properties**
- **Secrets > Properties**

</Tip>
