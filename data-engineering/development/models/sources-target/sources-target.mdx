Model sources and targets vary slightly from those of a pipeline. The primary difference is that all model sources and targets must point to tables in the SQL warehouse.

## Sources

When you create a new model, you need to define an input data source. The data source can be:

- Another model. You can drag a model from the Project tab of the left sidebar onto your canvas to use it as a source.
- A [Table gem](/data-analytics/gems/source-target/source-target). You can either use preconfigured tables from the Project tab of the left sidebar, or you can browse SQL warehouse tables in the Environment tab of the left sidebar.

## Targets

Target models let you define how you want to materialize your data using write formats. When you open a target model configuration, you'll see the following tabs:

- **Type & Format**: Update the format of the model between different table materialization types.
- **Location**: Update the location by overwriting the database, schema, or alias.
- **Schema**: Make schema changes and set optional dbt properties.
- **SQL Query**: Enable and create a custom SQL query to include at the end of the target model.
- **Write Options**: Choose a specific write mode such as overwrite, append, and merge.
