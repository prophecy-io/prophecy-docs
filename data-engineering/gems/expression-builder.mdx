Analyzing and manipulating data with Spark functions often requires building complex expressions that combine multiple functions. Prophecy makes this easier with the **Expression Builder**, which streamlines the creation of complex expressions, saving time and effort. It also helps you better understand the relationships between functions and their arguments.

## Spark Expression Builder

To navigate to the Spark Expression Builder:

1. Navigate to the column you want to edit, and open the expanded editor.
1. Click on the **Expression Builder** button.

A list of matching functions appears. When you click on a function, you see information about its syntax, arguments, and an example on how to use it.

### Insert

You can insert a function, column, or configuration into your expression.

To insert a function:

1. Navigate to, or search for the function you want to use.

### Run and Verify the output

You can attach to a cluster and run your pipeline for the current gem on the same screen.

To run your code:

1. Click the **Data** button to see your results.

Verify the results to ensure that your data analysis tasks are accurate and reliable.
