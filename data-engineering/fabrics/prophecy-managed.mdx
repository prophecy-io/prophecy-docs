description: Use a Prophecy-managed free trial fabric
---

If you don't have a Spark environment to connect to, you can use the Prophecy-managed Databricks fabric to get started with building your pipelines.

This fabric comes with a 14-day free trial. The Databricks connection includes some sample data and tables that you can use to try out different pipeline functions.

<Note>
  In the Prophecy-managed fabric, you can only change the [Databricks runtime
  version](https://docs.databricks.com/runtime/dbr.html#databricks-runtime). The auto-termination
  timeout, Executor and Driver Machine Type and job sizes are uneditable.
</Note>
