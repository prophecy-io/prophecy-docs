description: Connect to Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) accounts and containers
---

Prophecy supports direct integration with [Azure Data Lake Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction) (ADLS), allowing you to read from and write to ADLS containers as part of your data pipelines. This page explains how to configure the connection, what permissions are required, and how ADLS connections are managed and shared within your team.

## Prerequisites

Prophecy connects to ADLS using the credentials you provide. These are used to authenticate requests and authorize all file operations during pipeline execution.

To ensure Prophecy can read from and write to your storage account, you must have the following **Azure RBAC role** or equivalent permissions:

- **Storage Blob Data Contributor**: Read, write, and delete access to Blob storage containers and blobs.
