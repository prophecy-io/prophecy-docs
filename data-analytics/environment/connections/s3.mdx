description: Learn how to connect to Amazon S3 buckets

Prophecy supports direct integration with Amazon S3, allowing you to read from and write to S3 buckets as part of your data pipelines. This page explains how to configure the connection, what permissions are required, and how S3 connections are managed and shared within your team.

## Prerequisites

Prophecy connects to Amazon S3 using the AWS credentials you provide. These credentials are used to authenticate requests and authorize all file operations during pipeline execution. To ensure Prophecy can read from and write to S3 as needed, the credentials must grant the following permissions:

- `s3:ListBucket` to list the contents of the bucket.
- `s3:PutObject` to write files to the bucket.
- `s3:GetObject` to read files.

To learn more, visit [Required permissions for Amazon S3 API operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-policy-actions.html) in the AWS documentation.

## Feature support

The table below outlines whether the connection supports certain Prophecy features.

## Sharing connections within teams

Connections in Prophecy are stored within [fabrics](/data-analytics/environment/fabrics/prophecy-fabrics), which are assigned to specific teams. Once an S3 connection is added to a fabric, all team members who have access to the fabric can use the connection in their projects. No additional authentication is required—team members automatically inherit the access and permissions of the stored connection credentials.

<Warning>
Be mindful of the access level granted by the stored credentials. Anyone on the team will have the same permissions—including access to sensitive data if allowed.

To manage this securely, consider creating a dedicated fabric and team for high-sensitivity connections. This way, only approved users have access to those credentials.
</Warning>
