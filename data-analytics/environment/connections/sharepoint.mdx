Prophecy supports integration with Microsoft SharePoint, allowing you to read from and write to SharePoint document libraries as part of your data pipelines. This connection enables you to work directly with files stored in SharePoint for processing, transformation, and reporting.

## Prerequisites

To connect Prophecy to OneDrive, your Microsoft administrator must first [register Prophecy as an application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts#register-the-application) in Microsoft Entra ID. This registration provides the Client ID and Client Secret needed to authenticate Prophecy with Microsoft APIs.

As part of the setup, the following application-level permission must be granted to the registered app:

- `Sites.Manage.All`

This allows Prophecy to read and write content across SharePoint sites. Learn more in [Permissions for OneDrive and SharePoint API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/rest-api/concepts/permissions_reference?view=odsp-graph-online).

## Feature support

The table below outlines whether the connection supports certain Prophecy features.

| Feature                                                                    | Supported |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Read data with a [Source gem](/data-analytics/gems/source-target/file/sharepoint)                    | Yes       |
| Write data with a [Target gem](/data-analytics/gems/source-target/file/sharepoint)                   | Yes       |
| Browse data in the [Environment browser](/data-analytics/development/studio/studio#sidebar) | Yes       |
| Index files in the [Knowledge Graph](/data-analytics/ai/knowledge-graph/knowledge-graph)                     | No        |

## Limitations

Prophecy can only access files stored in the [document library](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/what-is-a-document-library-3b5976dd-65cf-4c9e-bf5a-713c10ca2872) of your SharePoint site. Make sure any files you want to import are placed there.

## Connection parameters

## Sharing connections within teams

Connections in Prophecy are stored within [fabrics](/data-analytics/environment/fabrics/prophecy-fabrics), which are assigned to specific teams. Once a SharePoint connection is added to a fabric, all team members who have access to the fabric can use the connection in their projects. No additional authentication is required—team members automatically inherit the access and permissions of the stored connection credentials.

<Warning>
Be mindful of the access level granted by the stored credentials. Anyone on the team will have the same permissions—including access to sensitive data if allowed.

To manage this securely, consider creating a dedicated fabric and team for high-sensitivity connections. This way, only approved users have access to those credentials.
</Warning>
