title: What are connections?
description: Use connections to read and write data from external sources
---

Prophecy lets you work with various data providers when building your pipelines. To read and write data from external sources, create **connections** inside a [Prophecy fabric](/data-analytics/environment/fabrics/prophecy-fabrics).

When you attach to a fabric with connections, you can:

- Reuse credentials that are established in the connection.
- Browse data from the data provider in the [Environment browser](/data-analytics/development/studio/studio#sidebar) of your Prophecy project.

<Info>
  Most connections are only used to read from and write to data sources. The SQL Warehouse
  connection is an exception: it also provides the compute environment for pipeline execution.

## Connections access

Prophecy controls access to connections through fabric-level permissions. To access a connection, you must have access to the fabric that contains the connection. You can only access fabrics that are assigned to one of your teams.

In this diagram, the lines show relationships between entities. `||--||` indicates a one-to-one relationship, `||--o{` indicates a one-to-many relationship (one entity on the left can relate to many entities on the right), and `}o--o{` indicates a many-to-many relationship.

## Add a new connection

To configure a new connection in a Prophecy fabric:

- Open the **Metadata** page from the left sidebar in Prophecy.
- Navigate to the **Fabric** tab.
- Open the fabric where you want to add the connection.
- Navigate to the **Connections** tab.
- Click **+ Add Connection**. This opens the **Create Connection** dialog.
- Select a data provider from the list of connection types.
- Click **Next** to open the connection details.
- Configure the connection and save your changes.

Learn about individual connection parameters in the connection's respective reference page.
