Use the following instructions to create a Prophecy fabric.

## Create a new fabric

Begin by creating a new fabric entity in Prophecy.

1. From the left sidebar, click the **+** sign.
1. On the Create Entity page, select **Fabric**.

### 1. Fill in the Basic Info tab

The **Basic Info** tab lets you define the key identifiers of the fabric.

1. Provide a name for the fabric.
1. (Optional) Provide a description for the fabric.
1. Select a [team](/data-analytics/administration/management/teams/teams) that can access the fabric.
1. Click **Continue**.

### 2. Fill in the Providers tab

The **Providers** tab allows you to configure what type of execution environment you would like to create.

1. Under **Provider Type**, select **Prophecy**.
1. For the **Provider**, select the SQL warehouse provider you want to use.
1. Click **Continue**.

<Info>You cannot edit the fabric provider after you create the fabric.</Info>

### 3. Fill in the Connections tab

The **Connections** tab allows you to store your credentials to various external data providers for reuse while attached to the fabric.

1. Under **SQL Warehouse Connection**, click **+ Connect SQL Warehouse**.
1. Configure connection details for the SQL warehouse provider you selected in the previous step. To understand the how to set up a connection for a specific provider, see [Connections](/data-analytics/environment/connections/connections).
1. Click **Complete**. Prophecy saves the fabric.

You can add **Ingress/Egress Connections** to your fabric if you want, but these are not required.

<Note>
  If you want to add [secrets](/data-analytics/environment/secrets/secrets) to your fabric, you need
  to save the fabric first. Then, you can add secrets to the created fabric.
</Note>

## Edit an existing fabric

To edit an existing fabric:

1. From the left sidebar, click the **Metadata** page.
1. Open the fabric you want to edit.
1. Update the fabric. Prophecy automatically saves your changes.
