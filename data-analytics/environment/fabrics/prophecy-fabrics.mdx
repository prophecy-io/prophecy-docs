title: What is a fabric?
description: Fabrics let you connect to external compute and data
---

A fabric is a Prophecy entity that contains all of the connection information you need to connect to **external compute** and **data storage**. You need fabrics to run pipelines.

<Note>
  Prophecy provides you with compute and data storage for Free and Professional Editions. Users on
  Express and Enterprise Editions need to connect to their own compute and data storage.
</Note>

## Key concepts

**Compute**: The SQL engine that executes the transformations and queries generated by your Prophecy pipelines. The compute engine processes your pipeline logic, runs SQL statements, and performs data transformations. In Prophecy, this is typically provided by your primary SQL warehouse connection (such as Databricks SQL, BigQuery, or Prophecy In Memory).

**Data storage**: The location where your source and target data is stored and persisted. This includes both the data you read from (sources) and the data you write to (targets) in your pipelines. Data storage can be coupled with your compute engine, such as when using Databricks SQL warehouses with Unity Catalog, or it can be separate, accessed through ingress/egress connections to external data providers.

## Components of a fabric

The following table describes how fabric components map to the key concepts.

| Component                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SQL Warehouse Connection   | Connection to the SQL compute engine and the coupled data storage for that provider. A primary warehouse connection is required for every Prophecy fabric to execute SQL queries generated by your pipeline.                               |
| Prophecy Automate          | Runtime that automatically comes with fabrics. Prophecy Automate extends SQL functionality by adding features like orchestration, scheduling, and data movement.                                                                           |
| Ingress/Egress Connections | Connections to external data providers. Each connection can be used to read and write data from supported locations. For the full list of supported connections, visit [Connections](/data-analytics/environment/connections/connections). |
| Secrets                    | Secrets are used to store sensitive data like credentials. These secrets are used to authenticate all connections in the fabric.                                                                                                           |

## Fabric provisioning

Prophecy fabrics are provisioned differently depending on your [Prophecy edition](/data-analytics/administration/platform/editions).

| Edition                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Free & Professional Editions | Each user automatically receives a personal fabric that is linked to their team. These fabrics run on **Prophecy In Memory**, and all execution is fully managed by Prophecy. Usage is billed in credits.                               |
| Express Edition              | Users create fabrics manually and connect them to their own Databricks SQL warehouse. Prophecy Automate is included, while Databricks costs are managed separately by the user.                                                         |
| Enterprise Edition           | Users create fabrics manually and can connect to any external SQL engine supported by Prophecy, including Databricks SQL warehouse and BigQuery. Prophecy Automate is included, and warehouse costs are managed separately by the user. |

## Supported primary SQL warehouses

Prophecy fabrics can be connected to one of several primary SQL warehouses. The warehouse you choose provides the compute and determines the SQL dialect for all pipelines in the fabric.

| SQL Warehouse      | Description                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Prophecy In Memory | Exclusive to Free and Professional Editions. This warehouse is fully managed by Prophecy and powered by DuckDB. All pipeline transformations execute using the DuckDB SQL dialect. |
| Databricks SQL     | Supported in Express and Enterprise Editions. Connect your own Databricks SQL warehouse to run pipeline transformations.                                                           |
| Google BigQuery    | Supported in Enterprise Edition. Connect to your BigQuery environment to run pipeline transformations.                                                                             |
