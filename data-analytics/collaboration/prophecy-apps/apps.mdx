title: "What are Prophecy Apps?"
description: "Package complex pipelines into easy-to-use applications"

Prophecy Apps simplify the process for non-technical users to run data pipelines through intuitive, form-based interfaces—no engineering required. Instead of writing or modifying pipeline code, users can rely on pre-built, templated apps to run pipelines quickly and consistently.

These reusable apps help teams collaborate more effectively by eliminating duplicate work and standardizing processes across users. Built-in logic and guardrails further reduce the risk of errors, guiding users through safe, tested execution paths.

## App capabilities

Prophecy Apps look and feel like simple forms, but they pack the following powerful capabilities:

- **Upload custom data to overwrite pipeline sources**

  Swap out input data without modifying pipeline logic. Whether you're running a pipeline with weekly reports or customer-specific datasets, upload your file to replace the default source.

- **Assign values to pipeline parameters**

  Set variables such as dates, thresholds, or regions at runtime. Parameters appear as form fields, making it easy to customize each run without writing code.

- **Preview, visualize, and download app-generated output data**

  Review data samples and charts to understand pipeline outputs. This lets you verify results before sharing, without digging into external storage systems.

- **Save and reuse app configurations**

  Save a set of parameter values and inputs as a configuration. Reuse it anytime to run the same job again for recurring tasks or standardized reports.

- **Schedule automated app runs**

  Set up your app to run on a regular basis to automate recurring workflows.

## Working with Prophecy Apps

Prophecy Apps live in the **App Browser**, where each app is linked to a specific data pipeline. You'll see apps from any project that has been shared with your team, making it easy to discover and reuse trusted workflows. Apps always run against the latest published version of their pipeline, so you can count on up-to-date logic and data sources.

If you want to build an app and turn your pipelines into simple, form-based tools that anyone on your team can use, follow our guide to [create a Prophecy App](/data-analytics/collaboration/prophecy-apps/app-creation).
