## AI

Prophecy provides a suite of AI capabilities to help you build data pipelines faster and more efficiently. Use AI to build pipelines, fix issues, generate documentation, and more.

- **Agent**: The Prophecy Agent specializes in building pipelines, adding transformations, and creating complete data workflows.
- **Copilot**: The Prophecy Copilot specializes in making quick fixes, suggesting expressions, and other one-click tasks.

## Projects

Projects serve as your primary workspace in Prophecy for building data pipelines. They are containers that organize related data transformations, tests, and schedules in one place.

## Pipelines

Pipelines are essential components in data processing workflows, enabling the automated movement and transformation of data. They define a sequence of steps that extract data from a source, process or transform it, and load it into a destination system.

## Gems

Gems are visual, modular components that represent data transformation logic in Prophecy. Each gem encapsulates a specific operation—such as reading data, filtering rows, or aggregating values—and automatically generates the corresponding code in your project's language. Gems are designed to connect together in a pipeline where data flows from one gem to the next.

## Studio

All of your pipeline development happens in the studio. The studio is a visual interface that allows you to build your pipelines. You can add and connect gems to the canvas to build your pipeline. When you open a project in the studio, you will see the canvas.

## Fabrics

Fabrics define the execution environment for your pipelines, including SQL warehouse connections, data ingress/egress connections, and secrets. Fabrics are automatically provisioned for users on the Professional Edition.

## Teams

Teams represent groups of users who collaborate on projects and share access to resources. When you create a project or a fabric, you assign it to a team. All users in that team will have access to the relevant project or fabric.
