description: 'Use @ mentions to refer to specific entities in your project'

As you write your prompt, you can refer to specific entities in your project using `@` mentions. When you type `@`, Prophecy suggests a list of matching entities to choose from.

## Supported entities

Use `@` mentions to refer to:

- Specific tables in your environment. (Tables will only appear if indexed by the [knowledge graph](/knowledge-graph).)
- Specific gems in your pipeline.
- Specific documentation templates in your project.

<Note>
  When referencing gems, refer to the gem label that identifies the instance of the gem, rather than
  the gem type (Aggregate, Join, etc).
</Note>

## Examples

```
// Example 1
How many records are in the @transactions table?

// Example 2
Aggregate the @orders_cleaned gem to show sum of order quantity per month
```
