title: '@ mentions'
description: 'Use @ mentions to refer to specific entities in your project'
---

Reference specific entities in your project using `@` mentions. When you type `@` or click the `@` button in the chat footer, Prophecy displays an autocomplete dropdown with matching entities from project.

Use `@` mentions to eliminate ambiguity when your prompt could refer to multiple entities. The
Agent uses the exact entity you mention rather than inferring from context, which reduces errors
in complex pipelines.

## How to use @ mentions

<Steps>
<Step title="Trigger the mention dropdown">
Type `@` in the chat input field, or click the `@` button in the chat footer. An autocomplete dropdown appears with suggested entities.
</Step>

<Step title="Search and select an entity">
  Type additional characters to filter the suggestions, or scroll through the list. Each entity type
  displays with a distinct icon to help you identify it quickly.
</Step>

<Step title="Insert the mention">
Click an entity from the dropdown, or use arrow keys to navigate and press Enter. The `@` mention is inserted into your prompt.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Supported entities

The autocomplete dropdown includes entities from your current project.

- Tables: Reference tables in your SQL warehouse using full table names, including database and schema information (for example, `database.schema.table`). This is useful when you want to add a table to your pipeline or ask the Agent to provide sample data from a table.

<Note>
  Only tables indexed by the knowledge graph appear in the autocomplete suggestions. If a table
  doesn't appear, ensure it's been indexed through the [knowledge graph
  indexer](/data-analytics/ai/knowledge-graph/indexer).
</Note>

- Gems: Reference specific gems in your current pipeline by their label. Use the [gem label](/data-analytics/gems/gems#gem-instance) that identifies the instance, not the gem type. This is useful when you want to add a transformation to your pipeline or ask the Agent to provide sample data from a gem.

- Documentation templates: Reference documentation templates in your project when generating documentation. Templates must exist in your project to appear in suggestions. Use with prompts like `Generate pipeline documentation using @custom_template`.

## Examples
