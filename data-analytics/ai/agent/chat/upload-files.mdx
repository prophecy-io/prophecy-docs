## Make the table available to the Agent

After uploading a file, reindex the [knowledge graph](/data-analytics/ai/knowledge-graph/indexer) so the Agent can discover and use the new table.

1. Open the **Environment** tab in the left sidebar.
1. Below your connections, locate the **Missing Tables?** callout.
1. Click **Refresh** to trigger the knowledge graph indexer.

<Warning>
  The Agent relies on the knowledge graph to find tables. If you skip reindexing, the Agent won't be
  able to locate your uploaded file table.
</Warning>

Once indexed, the Agent can reference the table using `@` mentions or discover it through natural language queries. The Agent will use the [Table gem](/data-analytics/gems/source-target/table) to read the file into your pipeline.
