Each Agent response that modifies your pipeline creates a checkpoint in the [project version history](/data-analytics/development/versioning/version-control). Use checkpoints to revert to previous pipeline states.

## How checkpoints work

When the Agent applies transformations to your pipeline, each response that creates or modifies gems becomes a checkpoint. In Git terms, this is a commit. The commit capture the complete state of your project (code) at that moment.

Because Prophecy uses Git, checkpoints follow standard DevOps practices and allow you to revert to previous states of the project without losing any history.

## Restore from a checkpoint

Each chat response that creates a checkpoint displays a **Restore** button. Use this button to return your pipeline to the state captured by that checkpoint.

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate the checkpoint">
Find the chat response containing the transformation you want to restore to. Responses that created checkpoints display a **Restore** button.
</Step>

<Step title="Restore the checkpoint">
  Click **Restore** on the chat response. The pipeline returns to the exact state it was in when
  that transformation was applied.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify the restoration">
Review the pipeline canvas to confirm it matches the expected state. All gems and configurations from that checkpoint are restored.
</Step>
</Steps>

Restoring a checkpoint does not affect:

- Chat conversation history. Your chat messages remain visible.
- Project version history. All checkpoints remain available for future restoration.
