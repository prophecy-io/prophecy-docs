Reset the Agent chat to clear the conversation history and start a new session. Use this when the conversation context is no longer relevant, the Agent's responses are off track, or you want to begin a new line of inquiry without previous chat context.

<Info>
  You can only have one chat session open at a time. If you want to start a new session, you need to
  reset the current session.
</Info>

## Steps

1. Open the **…** (more options) menu in the top right corner of the chat window.
1. Under **Chat Options**, click **Reset chat**.
1. The chat conversation is cleared, and you can start a new session.

## What gets reset

When you reset the chat:

- All previous messages and conversation history are removed from the chat interface.
- The Agent loses context from previous prompts and responses.
- You start with a clean conversation state.

## What is preserved

Resetting the chat does not affect:

- Pipeline state and changes made during the conversation. All transformations remain in your pipeline.
- Project version history. Commits created by the Agent are saved in [project version history](/data-analytics/development/versioning).
