description: 'What does the Agent do?'
---

The Prophecy Agent uses natural language to interact with your data warehouse and build pipelines.

Describe what you need, and the Agent searches metadata, retrieves sample data, generates transformations, and optimizes existing pipelines. Use it to build pipelines incrementally or generate complete pipelines from a single prompt.

## Available features

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Search through your connected warehouse">
  Use table metadata—table names, schemas, owners, and tags—to locate datasets from your fabric.
  When you don't know the exact table name or work with many tables, searching through metadata
  eliminates guesswork and reduces time spent browsing schema lists.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Retrieve and visualize sample data from the warehouse">
  Preview data samples and visualizations before selecting datasets for your pipeline. Understanding
  column structures, data patterns, and potential quality issues helps you make informed decisions
  about which tables to use.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Build pipelines step-by-step or all in one prompt">
  Generate complete pipelines from a single description when requirements are clear, or build
  incrementally gem by gem, adding one transformation at a time in a linear sequence. Instead of
  manually dragging gems onto the canvas and configuring each step, describe your goal and let the
  Agent handle the setup.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Remove redundant steps and improve readability">
  Clean up existing pipelines by removing unnecessary transformations and consolidating logic.
  Easier-to-maintain pipelines execute faster, and clearer logic helps teammates understand your
  work without deciphering complex transformation chains.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Summarize pipeline logic and datasets">
  Get a high-level explanation of what a pipeline does and which datasets it uses without reading
  through every transformation. Understanding existing pipelines quickly helps with onboarding,
  while documenting your own work makes it easier for others to use and modify later.
