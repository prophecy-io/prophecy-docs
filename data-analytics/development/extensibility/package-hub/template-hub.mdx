description: Play with sample pipelines provided in the Template Hub
---

The Package Hub also includes a set of sample pipelines in the Template Hub. These pipelines cater to specific industry use cases. You can use these pipelines to learn how to run data processing flows and configure gems in a familiar context.

<Note>The Template Hub is only available for users who joined Prophecy after version 4.1.0.</Note>

## Use a pipeline template

At the top of the Package Hub homepage, select the **Template Hub** tab. As you browse through the available pipelines, keep in mind that each template contains several tables, and at least one pipeline.

There are two ways to use a pipeline template.

- **Read-only mode**: If you click on a pipeline from the Template Hub, this opens the pipeline in read-only mode. You can explore all project configurations and run any pipeline in the project, but no changes you make will be saved.

- **Edit mode**: If you click **Edit** on a pipeline in the Template Hub, a copy of the project is created in your [personal team](/administration/teams-users/teams-users). This project is editable because it is completely separate from the original pipeline template. You can always open the original from the Template Hub to reference a working pipeline.

<Note>
  Prophecy provides a Databricks compute environment for pipeline templates. This means that you
  don't need your own fabric to run these pipelines—you'll use the Prophecy-provided fabric. This
  fabric will be available automatically in the pipeline template project.

## List of pipeline templates

The following lists the SQL pipelines available in each category.

### Transportation

---

#### `l2_gold_airport_delay_metrics`

Computes the airport-level delay metrics using flight data from the past 30 days. It aggregates departure and arrival delays, cancellation rates, and overall on-time performance for both origin and destination airports.
