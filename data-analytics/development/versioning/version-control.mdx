Versioning in Prophecy helps teams track changes, collaborate efficiently, and roll back when needed. It also supports auditing and compliance by keeping a clear, versioned history of all updates. This page details the stages of the visual workflow.

## Workflow

The following sections describe the versioning workflow, where Prophecy creates a linear version history per project where you can audit changes, see collaborator activity, and revert to previous versions.

### Save to draft

As you develop your project, Prophecy **automatically** preserves your changes. However, we recommend periodically saving your changes as drafts. To do so:

1. Open the version menu in the Studio header.
1. Click **Save to draft**.
1. Fill out the **Version description** to summarize the changes made since the last saved version, or let AI generate one for you.
1. Review your changes in the **Changes since last saved** section.
1. Click **Save**.

Your changes are now saved as a draft.

### Publish a new version

When you're ready to use your project in production, you'll publish it. For an in-depth review of the publication process, see [project publication](/data-analytics/production/publication).

### Show version history

Prophecy tracks different versions of your project that you save and publish. To access the version history:

1. Open the version menu in the Studio header.
1. Click **Show version history**.

The top level versions represent the published versions of the project. Expand each version to see the drafts that were saved for that version. Each version displays the author and time since the version was saved.

### Restore previous version

To restore a previous version:

1. Open the version menu in the Studio header.
1. Click **Show version history**.
1. Find the version you want to restore. (This can be a published version or a draft.)
1. Hover the version and click **... > Restore this version**.

### Publish a previous version

To publish a previous version:

1. Open the version menu in the Studio header.
1. Click **Show version history**.
1. Find the version you want to publish. (This can be a published version only—not a draft.)
1. Hover the version and click **... > Publish**.
