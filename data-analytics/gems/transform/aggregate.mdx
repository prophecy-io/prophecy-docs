| Expressions       | Includes the aggregations that you wish to perform. Each aggregation will produce a new output column. |

## Example

Suppose you have a dataset of orders that includes the customer_id of each customer. You can use the Aggregate gem to:

- Group by the **customer_id** column. This will apply aggregations per each unique customer.
- Count the number of orders per customer using `count(order_id)`.
- Retrieve the total amount spent by the customer using `sum(order_amount)`.
- View customers who made less than three orders. To do so, add the **Having** condition `count(order_id) < 3`.
