This page describes the **Text-specific properties** that appear in the **Properties** tab of Source and Target gems. These settings are the same for text files regardless of which connection type is configured in the gem (for example, S3, SFTP, or SharePoint).

If you need details on configuring a Source or Target gem end to end (including all tabs such as **Location**), see the documentation for the specific file storage connection.
