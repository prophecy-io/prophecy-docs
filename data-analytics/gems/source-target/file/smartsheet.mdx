Use a Source and Target gem to read from or write to Smartsheet locations in Prophecy pipelines. This page covers supported file formats, how to create the gem, and how to configure connection details and paths for both Source and Target gems.

## Supported file formats

1. Add a new Source or Target gem to your pipeline canvas and open the configuration.
1. In the **Type** tab, select **Smartsheet**.
