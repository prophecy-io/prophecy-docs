## Overview

Use the Email gem to send output tables from your pipeline to others via email. You can configure static values for recipients, subject, and body, or dynamically populate these fields from columns in your input dataset using the **Use column** option.

## Input

The Email gem supports one or two input ports, depending on how you want to provide email content and attachments.

- **Single input port**: The dataset can be used for both email content (To, Cc, Bc, Subject, Body) and attachment data (if enabled).
- **Two input ports**: The first input port provides email content and parameters, while the second port provides attachment data.

The gem will send email(s) when it runs. No output table will be written to your data warehouse.

## Parameters

Review the following Email gem parameters.

Parameters can be set manually or configured dynamically using the **Use column** option. When you enable the **Use column** checkbox, the gem field is automatically populated with the value from the specified column in your input dataset.
